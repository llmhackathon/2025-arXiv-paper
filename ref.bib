The extracted properties include reported composition, processing method, microstructure, density, hardness, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength (or maximum compression strength), elongation (or maximum compression strain), and Young’s modulus. Additionally, descriptors (e.g. grain size) not included in previous reviews were also extracted for articles that reported them. The database is hosted and continually updated on an open data platform, Citrination. To promote interpretation, some data are graphically presented.}

The data associated with that research paper, titled “Machine learning-based prediction of phases in high-entropy alloys”, is presented in this data article. This dataset is a systematic documentation and comprehensive survey of experimentally reported HEA microstructures. It contains microstructural phase experimental observations and metallurgy-specific features as introduced and reported in peer-reviewed research articles. The dataset is provided with this article as a supplementary file. Since the dataset was collected from experimental peer-reviewed articles, these data can provide insights into the microstructural characteristics of HEAs, can be used to improve the optimization HEA phases, and have an important role in machine learning, material informatics, as well as in other fields.}

In this paper{,} we introduce AlabOS{,} a general-purpose software framework for orchestrating experiments and managing resources{,} with an emphasis on automated laboratories for materials synthesis and characterization. AlabOS features a reconfigurable experiment workflow model and a resource reservation mechanism{,} enabling the simultaneous execution of varied workflows composed of modular tasks while eliminating conflicts between tasks. To showcase its capability{,} we demonstrate the implementation of AlabOS in a prototype autonomous materials laboratory{,} the A-Lab{,} with around 3500 samples synthesized over 1.5 years."}

                   Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architectures, which
                   were thoroughly validated in DeepSeek-V2. Furthermore,
                   DeepSeek-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for
                   load balancing and sets a multi-token prediction training

                   by Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages

  abstract      = {Accessibility is a major challenge of machine learning (ML). Typical ML models are built by specialists and require specialized hardware/software as well as ML experience to validate. This makes it challenging for non-technical collaborators and endpoint users (e.g. physicians) to easily provide feedback on model development and to gain trust in ML. The accessibility challenge also makes collaboration more difficult and limits the ML researcher's exposure to realistic data and scenarios that occur in the wild. To improve accessibility and facilitate collaboration, we developed an open-source Python package, Gradio, which allows researchers to rapidly generate a visual interface for their ML models. Gradio makes accessing any ML model as easy as sharing a URL. Our development of Gradio is informed by interviews with a number of machine learning researchers who participate in interdisciplinary collaborations. Their feedback identified that Gradio should support a variety of interfaces and frameworks, allow for easy sharing of the interface, allow for input manipulation and interactive inference by the domain expert, as well as allow embedding the interface in iPython notebooks. We developed these features and carried out a case study to understand Gradio's usefulness and usability in the setting of a machine learning collaboration between a researcher and a cardiologist.},

               food science. Here, we present FART (Flavor Analysis and
               Recognition Transformer), a chemical language model capable of
               predicting molecular taste from chemical structure. Trained on
               the largest public dataset (15,025 compounds) of molecular
               tastants to date, FART is the first model capable of parallel
               predictions across four taste categories: sweet, bitter, sour,
               and umami. FART achieves an accuracy above 91\% for parallel
               taste prediction and outperforms previous state-of-the-art
               binary classifier models that specialize on predicting one taste
               class. Its transformer architecture allows for interpretability
               through gradient-based visualization of molecular features. The
               model identifies key structural elements driving taste
               properties and demonstrates utility in analyzing known tastants
               as well as novel compounds. By releasing both the model and
               dataset, we equip the food science community with tools for
               rapid taste prediction, accelerating flavor compound development

@article{Zhang2023,
   abstract = {High-entropy materials provide a versatile platform for the rational design of novel candidates with exotic performances. Recently, it has been demonstrated that high-entropy ceramics (HECs), depending on their compositions, show great application potential because of their superior structural and functional properties. However, the immense phase space behind HECs significantly hinders the efficient design and exploitation of high-performance HECs through traditional trial-and-error experiments and expensive ab-initio calculations. Machine learning (ML), on the other hand, has become a popular approach to accelerate the discovery of HECs and screen HECs with exceptional properties. In this article, we review the recent progress of ML applications in discovering and designing novel HECs, including carbides, nitrides, borides, and oxides. We thoroughly discuss different ingredients that are involved in ML applications in HECs, including data collection, feature engineering, model refinement, and prediction performance improvement. We finally provide an outlook on the challenges and development directions of future ML models for HEC predictions.},

abstract="Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an emerging field in AI that aims to address the opaque nature of machine learning models. Furthermore, it has been shown that XAI can be used to extract input-output relationships, making them a useful tool in chemistry to understand structure-property relationships. However, one of the main limitations of XAI methods is that they are developed for technically oriented users. We propose the XpertAI framework that integrates XAI methods with large language models (LLMs) accessing scientific literature to generate accessible natural language explanations of raw chemical data automatically. We conducted 5 case studies to evaluate the performance of XpertAI. Our results show that XpertAI combines the strengths of LLMs and XAI tools in generating specific, scientific, and interpretable explanations.",

abstract="The Joint Automated Repository for Various Integrated Simulations (JARVIS) is an integrated infrastructure to accelerate materials discovery and design using density functional theory (DFT), classical force-fields (FF), and machine learning (ML) techniques. JARVIS is motivated by the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) principles of developing open-access databases and tools to reduce the cost and development time of materials discovery, optimization, and deployment. The major features of JARVIS are: JARVIS-DFT, JARVIS-FF, JARVIS-ML, and JARVIS-tools. To date, JARVIS consists of ≈40,000 materials and ≈1 million calculated properties in JARVIS-DFT, ≈500 materials and ≈110 force-fields in JARVIS-FF, and ≈25 ML models for material-property predictions in JARVIS-ML, all of which are continuously expanding. JARVIS-tools provides scripts and workflows for running and analyzing various simulations. We compare our computational data to experiments or high-fidelity computational methods wherever applicable to evaluate error/uncertainty in predictions. In addition to the existing workflows, the infrastructure can support a wide variety of other technologically important applications as part of the data-driven materials design paradigm. The JARVIS datasets and tools are publicly available at the website: https://jarvis.nist.gov.",

More than a decade later, the Materials Project has become an indispensable tool used by more than 600,000 materials researchers around the world. This Perspective describes how the Materials Project, as a data platform and a software ecosystem, has helped to shape research in data-driven materials science. We cover how sustainable software and computational methods have accelerated materials design while becoming more open source and collaborative in nature. Next, we present cases where the Materials Project was used to understand and discover functional materials. We then describe our efforts to meet the needs of an expanding user base, through technical infrastructure updates ranging from data architecture and cloud resources to interactive web applications. Finally, we discuss opportunities to better aid the research community, with the vision that more accessible and easy-to-understand materials data will result in democratized materials knowledge and an increasingly collaborative community.",

volume="15",

pages="10570",
abstract="The generation of plausible crystal structures is often the first step in predicting the structure and properties of a material from its chemical composition. However, most current methods for crystal structure prediction are computationally expensive, slowing the pace of innovation. Seeding structure prediction algorithms with quality generated candidates can overcome a major bottleneck. Here, we introduce CrystaLLM, a methodology for the versatile generation of crystal structures, based on the autoregressive large language modeling (LLM) of the Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format. Trained on millions of CIF files, CrystaLLM focuses on modeling crystal structures through text. CrystaLLM can produce plausible crystal structures for a wide range of inorganic compounds unseen in training, as demonstrated by ab initio simulations. Our approach challenges conventional representations of crystals, and demonstrates the potential of LLMs for learning effective models of crystal chemistry, which will lead to accelerated discovery and innovation in materials science.",

abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one.In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally varound the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

abstract = {Attention-based architectures, in particular transformers, are at the heart of a technological revolution. Interestingly, in addition to helping obtain state-of-the-art results on a wide range of applications, the attention mechanism intrinsically provides meaningful insights on the internal behavior of the model. Can these insights be used as explanations? Debate rages on. In this paper, we mathematically study a simple attention-based architecture and pinpoint the differences between post-hoc and attention-based explanations. We show that they provide quite different results, and that, despite their limitations, post-hoc methods are capable of capturing more useful insights than merely examining the attention weights.},

We identify two fundamental axioms— Sensitivity and Implementation Invariance that attribution methods ought to satisfy. We show that they are not satisfied by most known attribution methods, which we consider to be a fundamental weakness of those methods. We use the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method called Integrated Gradients. Our method requires no modification to the original network and is extremely simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a network, and to enable users to engage with models better.},

abstract={To close the gap between the rates of computational screening and experimental realization of novel materials1,2, we introduce the A-Lab, an autonomous laboratory for the solid-state synthesis of inorganic powders. This platform uses computations, historical data from the literature, machine learning (ML) and active learning to plan and interpret the outcomes of experiments performed using robotics. Over 17{\thinspace}days of continuous operation, the A-Lab realized 41 novel compounds from a set of 58 targets including a variety of oxides and phosphates that were identified using large-scale ab initio phase-stability data from the Materials Project and Google DeepMind. Synthesis recipes were proposed by natural-language models trained on the literature and optimized using an active-learning approach grounded in thermodynamics. Analysis of the failed syntheses provides direct and actionable suggestions to improve current techniques for materials screening and synthesis design. The high success rate demonstrates the effectiveness of artificial-intelligence-driven platforms for autonomous materials discovery and motivates further integration of computations, historical knowledge and robotics.},

abstract = {This article describes advancements in the ongoing digital transformation in materials science and engineering. It is driven by domain-specific successes and the development of specialized digital data spaces. There is an evident and increasing need for standardization across various subdomains to support science data exchange across entities. The MaterialDigital Initiative, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, takes on a key role in this context, fostering collaborative efforts to establish a unified materials data space. The implementation of digital workflows and Semantic Web technologies, such as ontologies and knowledge graphs, facilitates the semantic integration of heterogeneous data and tools at multiple scales. Central to this effort is the prototyping of a knowledge graph that employs application ontologies tailored to specific data domains, thereby enhancing semantic interoperability. The collaborative approach of the Initiative's community provides significant support infrastructure for understanding and implementing standardized data structures, enhancing the efficiency of data-driven processes in materials development and discovery. Insights and methodologies developed via the MaterialDigital Initiative emphasize the transformative potential of ontology-based approaches in materials science, paving the way toward simplified integration into a unified, consolidated data space of high value.},

abstract = {The scientific landscape is undergoing rapid transformations with the advent of the digital age which revolutionizes research methodologies. In materials science and engineering, an adoption of modern data management techniques is desirable to maximize the efficiency and accessibility of research efforts. Traditional practices in testing laboratories are usually inadequate for efficient data acquisition and utilization as they lead to local storage and difficulty in publication and correlation with other results. Electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) are promising prospects in this respect. Semantic concepts and ontologies enhance interoperability by standardizing experimental data representation. An in-laboratory pipeline seamlessly integrating an ELN with transformation scripts to convert experimental into interoperable data in a machine-actionable format is created in this study as a proof of concept. Tensile test results and the corresponding tensile test ontology are used exemplary. Linking ELN data to semantic concepts enriches the stored information while improving interpretability and reusability. Involving undergraduate students builds a bridge between theory and practice during their training and promotes their digital skills. This study underscores the potential of ELNs and knowledge representations as beneficial means toward improved data management practices that enhance collaborative research and education while ensuring compatibility with evolving standards and technologies.},

abstract  ="In the search for alternative energy sources due to the depletion of fossil fuels{,} green hydrogen energy produced from the water splitting reaction is considered to be a promising candidate owing to its high energy density and zero carbon emission. This reaction involves two electrons for the production of hydrogen at the cathode and four electrons for the production of oxygen at the anode. Therefore{,} the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is as crucial as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However{,} due to the sluggish kinetics of OER and the low abundance and high cost of the state-of-the-art RuO2 and IrO2 catalysts (noble metals){,} it is necessary to develop alternative low-cost{,} highly abundant{,} reasonably active{,} and stable catalysts to realize their industrial application in the water splitting reaction. In this case{,} the sol–gel process involves wet chemical synthesis using low-cost transition metal precursors for the production of various nanostructures{,} specifically oxide materials. In recent decades{,} a plethora of sol–gel-synthesized materials including metal oxides{,} hydroxides{,} phosphides{,} sulfides{,} and their derivatives have demonstrated remarkable efficiency as heterostructure catalysts in promoting water splitting activities including oxygen evolution reactions. In this method{,} the precursor molecules are mainly dissolved in alcohol or water{,} forming a sol{,} and then converted to gel via various approaches{,} and eventually dried to obtain the resultant catalyst. Accordingly{,} anticipating continuous growth in the research on these materials due to their cost-effective{,} easy fabrication{,} and ability to realize industrial applications{,} a comprehensive review addressing the enhancement of sol–gel-synthesized composites becomes imperative. This review aims to provide a thorough analysis of the recent research advancements in the sol–gel approach and resulting materials for OER. Particularly{,} we focus on the recent developments{,} showcasing their potential applications and reasons why the prepared materials display enhanced catalytic properties. Furthermore{,} a detailed discussion of prospective avenues for future research is presented."}

abstract = {Abstract The Na3[Ru2(μ-CO3)4] complex is acting as a water oxidation catalyst in a homogeneous system. Due to the significance of heterogeneous systems and the effect of bicarbonate on the kinetic, we studied the bicarbonate effect on the heterogeneous electrocatalyst by entrapping the Na3[Ru2(μ-CO3)4] complex in a sol-gel matrix. We have developed two types of sol-gel electrodes, which differ by the precursor, and are demonstrating their stability over a minimum of 200 electrochemical cycles. The pH increases affected the currents and kcat for both types of electrodes, and their hydrophobicity, which was obtained from the precursor type, influenced the electrocatalytic process rate. The results indicate that NaHCO3 has an important role in the catalytic activity of the presented heterogeneous systems; without NaHCO3, the diffusing species is probably OH−, which undergoes diffusion via the Grotthuss mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to present a simple and fast one-step entrapment process for the Na3[Ru2(μ-CO3)4] complex by the sol-gel method under standard laboratory conditions. The results contribute to optimizing the WSP, ultimately helping expand the usage of hydrogen as a green and more readily available energy source.},

RuO2 as a benchmark OER catalyst, its wide application has always been limited by slow reaction kinetics and limited persistence. In this paper, Mn-doped RuO2 material was developed and the optimum doping ratio was identified for using as an OER electrocatalyst under general purpose pH media. Mn0.1Ru0.9O2 exhibited a lower overpotential value of 224 mV in acidic environment with a Tafel slope value of 51.62 mV dec−1. Moreover, in alkaline and neutral environments, overpotentials of 231 mV and 376 mV were required to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2, respectively. In addition, through continuous stability testing over 24 h in alkaline, acidic and neutral solutions, it has been further demonstrated that the Mn-doped RuO2 material exhibits extremely high stability. The advancements in this research offer crucial insight into the rational development of efficient and durable RuO2-based catalysts.}

Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the co-doping breaks the traditional linear constraint relationship (GOOH − GOH = 3.2 eV) and the theoretical overvoltage is reduced from 0.64 V (LaFeO3−δ) to 0.44 V (LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3−δ/N). Specifically{,} Ni-doping can accelerate electron transfer and improve the conductivity. Moreover{,} N-doping can reduce the adsorption energy of *OH/*O and enhance the adsorption energy of *OOH. We demonstrated that the optimized cation and anion co-doped LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3−δ/N perovskite oxide exhibits an excellent OER performance{,} with a low overpotential of 270.6 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 65 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH solution{,} markedly exceeding that of the parent perovskite oxide LaFeO3−δ (300.9 mV) and commercial IrO2 (289.1 mV). It also delivers decent durability with no significant degradation after a 35 h stability test.

abstract = {A novel electrochemical filter has been prepared for the effective adsorption and electrochemical oxidation of aqueous organic pollutants. The adsorptive electrode utilized in the electrochemical filter was a porous Graphite-RuO2 electrode decorated with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) adsorption layer, which was prepared by sol–gel coating, thermal decomposition, and vacuum filtration synthesis. The morphology and composition of adsorptive electrode characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed a uniform distribution of RuO2 active coating and MWCNTs adsorption layer. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the adsorptive electrode possessed a favorable oxygen evolution potential (OEP) of 1.42V and inner voltammetric charge 170.05mC·cm−2, which were higher than that of non-MWCNTs electrode. Furthermore, the mass transfer of adsorptive electrode was enhanced as high as 4.6-fold in the electrochemical filter. The optimal operation parameters obtained was 3mA·cm−2 and 7g·L−1 Na2SO4. Under this condition, the electrochemical filter can remove>97% of pyrrole and>75% of total organic carbon. The pyrrole oxidation mechanism of electrochemical filter was also investigated, revealed three dominant reaction stages: adsorption (≤0.3V), direct oxidation (0.3–1.2V) and indirect oxidation (>1.2V). In general, the high electrochemical performance of Graphite-RuO2-MWCNTs filter on pyrrole removal resulted from the enhanced mass transfer, which attributed to the synergistic effect of adsorption from MWCNTs, electrochemical oxidation and convection by filtration.}

Electrochemical characterization of redox-active molecules in solution requires exploration of manifold conditions (e.g., concentration, electrolyte type, pH, ionic strength), leading to tedious and time-consuming experiments that are prone to user error. Here, we introduce the Electrolab, a modular, automated electrochemical characterization platform that seamlessly interfaces with common laboratory instrumentation and low-cost electromechanical components. We integrated a gantry-type robot carrying a multipurpose nozzle assembly to dispense and mix solutions as well as degas and clean a cell containing multiplexed microelectrochemical arrays. The system operates using Python code and a universal Arduino-based controller. We demonstrate the Electrolab by autonomously analyzing a redox mediator by performing 200 voltammograms and data analysis steps across a range of conditions. In addition, the Electrolab is used to titrate a redox-active polymer solution to identify conditions for optimizing electrochemical performance. Overall, the Electrolab device enables high-throughput, systematic exploration of redox electrolytes, opening new avenues for closed-loop optimization.}

abstract = {Abstract Understanding crystalline structures based on their chemical bonding is growing in importance. In this context, chemical bonding can be studied with the Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP), allowing for quantifying interatomic bond strength. Here we present a new set of tools to automate the calculation of COHP and analyze the results. We use the program packages VASP and LOBSTER, and the Python packages atomate and pymatgen. The analysis produced by our tools includes plots, a textual description, and key data in a machine-readable format. To illustrate those capabilities, we have selected simple test compounds (NaCl, GaN), the oxynitrides BaTaO2N, CaTaO2N, and SrTaO2N, and the thermoelectric material Yb14Mn1Sb11. We show correlations between bond strengths and stabilities in the oxynitrides and the influence of the Mn−Sb bonds on the magnetism in Yb14Mn1Sb11. Our contribution enables high-throughput bonding analysis and will facilitate the use of bonding information for machine learning studies.},

            Self-driving laboratories (SDLs), powered by robotics, automation and artificial intelligence, accelerate scientific discoveries through autonomous experimentation. However, their adoption and transferability are limited by the lack of standardized software across diverse SDLs. In this work, we introduce IvoryOS – an open-source orchestrator that automatically generates web interfaces for Python-based SDLs. It ensures interoperability by dynamically updating the user interfaces with the plugged components and their functionalities. The interfaces enable users to directly control SDLs and design workflows through a drag-and-drop user interface. Additionally, the workflow manager provides no-code configuration for iterative execution, supporting both human-in-the-loop and closed-loop experimentation. We demonstrate the integration of IvoryOS with six SDLs across two institutes, showcasing its adaptability and utility across platforms at various development stages. The plug-and-play and low-code feature of IvoryOS addresses the rapidly evolving demands of SDL development and significantly lowers the barrier to entry for building and managing SDLs.},

ABSTRACT = {Applications of redox processes range over a number of scientific fields. This review article summarizes the theory behind the calculation of redox potentials in solution for species such as organic compounds, inorganic complexes, actinides, battery materials, and mineral surface-bound-species. Different computational approaches to predict and determine redox potentials of electron transitions are discussed along with their respective pros and cons for the prediction of redox potentials. Subsequently, recommendations are made for certain necessary computational settings required for accurate calculation of redox potentials. This article reviews the importance of computational parameters, such as basis sets, density functional theory (DFT) functionals, and relativistic approaches and the role that physicochemical processes play on the shift of redox potentials, such as hydration or spin orbit coupling, and will aid in finding suitable combinations of approaches for different chemical and geochemical applications. Identifying cost-effective and credible computational approaches is essential to benchmark redox potential calculations against experiments. Once a good theoretical approach is found to model the chemistry and thermodynamics of the redox and electron transfer process, this knowledge can be incorporated into models of more complex reaction mechanisms that include diffusion in the solute, surface diffusion, and dehydration, to name a few. This knowledge is important to fully understand the nature of redox processes be it a geochemical process that dictates natural redox reactions or one that is being used for the optimization of a chemical process in industry. In addition, it will help identify materials that will be useful to design catalytic redox agents, to come up with materials to be used for batteries and photovoltaic processes, and to identify new and improved remediation strategies in environmental engineering, for example the reduction of actinides and their subsequent immobilization. Highly under-investigated is the role of redox-active semiconducting mineral surfaces as catalysts for promoting natural redox processes. Such knowledge is crucial to derive process-oriented mechanisms, kinetics, and rate laws for inorganic and organic redox processes in nature. In addition, molecular-level details still need to be explored and understood to plan for safer disposal of hazardous materials. In light of this, we include new research on the effect of iron-sulfide mineral surfaces, such as pyrite and mackinawite, on the redox chemistry of actinyl aqua complexes in aqueous solution.},

abstract = {Concrete, as the most widely used construction material, is inextricably connected with human development. Despite conceptual and methodological progress in concrete science, concrete formulation for target properties remains a challenging task due to the ever-increasing complexity of cementitious systems. With the ability to tackle complex tasks autonomously, machine learning (ML) has demonstrated its transformative potential in concrete research. Given the rapid adoption of ML for concrete mixture design, there is a need to understand methodological limitations and formulate best practices in this emerging computational field. Here, we review the areas in which ML has positively impacted concrete science, followed by a comprehensive discussion of the implementation, application, and interpretation of ML algorithms. We conclude by outlining future directions for the concrete community to fully exploit the capabilities of ML models.},

abstract = {Compressive strength determination of high-performance concrete (HPC) is necessary for its practical usage. However, experimental testing for this purpose is resource intensive and time-consuming. Recently, machine learning has emerged in this field, especially data-driven modeling. In this study, a novel hybrid model for the compressive strength prediction of HPC is developed using the cascade forward neural network (CFNN) and artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization. The hybrid model used the ABC optimization method to select the optimal architecture of the neural network. A comprehensive database of 2171 data points containing information about cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, coarse aggregate, sand, and age as input variables, and compressive strength as output variable is used to develop the model. Results indicated that the optimal neural network architecture selected by the ABC method consists of 2 layers and the developed model (CFNN-ABC) could accurately predict the compressive strength of HPC with correlation (R) and determination coefficients (R2) of 0.976 and 0.953, respectively. The feature importance of the model revealed that the cement and sand were more influential features as compared to the other features. The partial dependence analysis demonstrated the effect of variation in input parameters on the attained compressive strength. Furthermore, the model validation with previously developed models using performance indices showed that the proposed hybrid model outperformed other models in all performance indices including root mean square error (RMSE ∼ 4.04) and mean absolute error (MAE ∼ 3.10). Therefore, the present work provides a novel and efficient option to predict the compressive strength of HPC which can aid in the design of sustainable infrastructures without going through costly and time-intensive experimentation.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, * * *, 148-156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

@article{Ke2017,
abstract = {Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB LightGBM. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.},
